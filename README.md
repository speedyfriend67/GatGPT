# DuckDuckGo Search

This is a simple HTML page that allows users to enter a query and retrieve instant answers using the DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter your query in the input field.
3. Click the "Search" button.
4. View the search results below the input.

## How it Works

- The HTML file includes a form with an input field, a search button, and a div to display the search results.
- The JavaScript code makes an asynchronous request to the DuckDuckGo API, retrieves the instant answer, and updates the display accordingly.

## Dependencies

- None

## Important Note

- Be sure to review DuckDuckGo's terms of service for usage guidelines when using their API.
